Welcome to the pricing service web.

This was my first app using Flask and MongoDB.

The idea of the web is that you can register yourself as a user and once you have done that, you can create your own alerts for an specific item you would like yo know the price.
In the web you are going to find a list of available stores where you can search the item (stores are created, edited or deleted only by administrators).
In order to create the alert, you have to write the item's url, a name and a price limit. 
So, finally, the program is going to sent you an email (the one you use to register, after validation) when the item's price is below the limit.
